# About me

I'm a computer vision and deep learning algorithm engineer and researcher. In recent years I've worked mostly on learning based approaches with applications that include change detection, scene understanding, image compression, 3D reconstruction and object tracking.

I also have previous experience in image processing and electro-optics.

I completed my M.Sc in Electrical Engineering at the Technion under the supervision of Prof. Yoav Schechner, and B.Sc in Physics and Electrical Engineering at the Tel-Aviv University.

I enjoy programming puzzles, traveling, spending time with my family, and premier league football. Not necessarily in that order.
